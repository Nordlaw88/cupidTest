# cupidTest
The 'OKCupid Matching Challenge' involves reading a large collection of data in JSON format (read here through STDIN), and using the 'OKCupid Matching Algorithm' to find the top 10 'matches' for each profile (sorted in descending order). A complete description of this magic 'matching algorithm' can be found in the PDF file included here. A sample input JSON file is included as well.
